We want to play codenames on the computer. We want to have an instance of the game consisting of the board, the key, 1 red and 1 blue key master, 1 red and 1 blue guess team. The following conditions must hold : 

1) The key may only be visible to the key masters.
2) The game ends when either the red or blue team wins.

We may start with two classes - Game and Player. 

#Game#
Game should initialize an instance with a random selection of n = 3k+1 words, where k = 8 for the ordinary game. It may accept a wordlist, or have one as default. 
Game should also initialize the instance with 2 masters, and 2 teams. 
A random selection of n words must be stored in an instance variable (list of lists).
A random key must then also be generated for k red words, k blue words, k white words, and 1 black word and be stored away (maybe as dict).
Game should allow printing out the board at any state by anyone. For eg. the instance may be passed to a print method of Player.
Addtl methods for game play.


#Player#
Player should initialize instances of players. A boolean keyword may indicate whether or not it is a master. The property must also be stored away in an instance variable. 
Each Player may print the state of the board.
Masters may print the key. 
Players should be able to get the property isMaster out.
